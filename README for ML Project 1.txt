README for ML Project 1

Please open the ipynb file on google colab or jupyter notebook. Then import the dataset zip files to the /content directory (working directory) i.e outside the sample_data directory on google colab.

Now run the first cell to extract the zip files. Then create a directory for enron2 and move the test and training directories into enron2 in the same way it is done for enron1 and enron4.

After this step run all the cells using the run all option (in runtime in google colab toolbar)

Thank you!
